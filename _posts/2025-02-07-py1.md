# values and functions

```haskell
a = 5
```

Here the symbol `a` is assigned with the value 5. 

```haskell
a = 2 + 3
```

Here the symbol `a` is assigned with the result of calculating 2 + 2, which also is 5.

```haskell
sum x y = x + y
a = sum 2 3
```

Here the symbol `sum` is defined as a function that takes who arguments and returns the sum of those two numbers.
The value a is assigned to the result of calling `sum` with arguments 2 and 3, which calculates 2 + 3, which is still 5.

# currying

```haskell
addThree x = sum 3 x
```

Here we define a new function `addThree` that is defined as calling our earlier `sum` function with 3 and `x`.

```haskell
addThree x = (sum 3) x
```

Here we have rewritten addThree in curried form. This means that `sum` is first called with `3` as argument, and the result of that is a new
function that takes only one argument and we call that function with argument `x`. In general calling a function with many arguments can be seen as calling that function with the first argument, then the result of that with the second argument, etc.

# partial application

`sum 3` is called a partial application of `sum` with `3`. The result of that partial application is a function that takes only one argument and returns that argument + 3.

# eta-reduction

If you think about it, `sum 3` is exactly what our `addThree` function is supposed to do. Because of this we can simplify the definition with a process that is called eta-reduction.

```haskell
addThree = sum 3
```

Here we define a new name `addThree` for the function `sum 3` which is the function which takes one argument and returns that argument incremented by 3.

```haskell
sum = (+)
```

In a simular way we can define our `sum` function from earlier just as being equal to the `+` operator. We have to add the () to make it infix.

```haskell
addthree = (+ 3)
```

Finally we can also define our `addThree` function directly based on `+`.

# summary

All of these concepts will start to make more sense when writing more complex programs.
